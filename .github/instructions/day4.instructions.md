Day 4 — Resume Upload + Internship Listing

Goal: Build core user-facing pages and connect resume-upload APIs.

Frontend:

Build components:

UploadResume.jsx → connect to /resume/upload

InternshipList.jsx → connect to /internship/list

Use axios interceptors to attach JWT tokens.

Backend (if not done yet):

Ensure /resume/upload & /internship/list routes handle file parsing + vector storage.

Add sample internships for testing.

✅ Deliverable:

Resume upload and internship listing visible from frontend.

End-to-end test for one student-user flow.
